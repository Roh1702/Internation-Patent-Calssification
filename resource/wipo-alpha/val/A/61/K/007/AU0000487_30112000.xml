<txt xml:lang="EN"> CONTROL OF WOOL GROWTH IN SHEEP AND RELATED ANIMALSField ot the Invention:
This invention relates to a method and composition for permanently
reducing or preventing wool growth at a selected locality or localities in
sheep and related animals. In a particular application of the invention, the
breech and/or pizzle area of sheep are treated in order to prevent the
incidence of blow-fly strike and/or balanitis.Background of the Invention:
Blow-fly strike and balanitis (pizzle rot) are significant problems for
sheep and wool growers. It is estimated that in Australia alone, losses
exceeding $150 million per annum are caused by blow-fly strike and itscontainment. Current methods for containing blow-fly strike and balanitis include
crutching (i. e. periodic close shearing around the breech and hind legs),
ringing of the pizzle and the widely practised treatment known as the Mules
operation. The Mules operation or"mulesing"involves the removal of a large
flap of skin from lambs below the tail and down the hind leg using shears
and without anaesthetic. While providing effective life-long protectionagainst blow-fly strike, the operation causes considerable trauma to the
recipient animals and can be associated with long-term arthritic problems
and is likely to be phased out or banned for these reasons. The scarring
caused by the Mules operation may also reduce the sale price of the carcass
and hide. Consequently, considerable research has been directed to the
identification of non-surgicalmulesing methods. In Proc. Aust. Soc. Alimal Prod. 11,189-192 (1976) Pratt and Hopkins
disclosed the use of a number of cryogenic, irritant, fixative and proteindenaturizing agents. Of these, the protein denaturizing agents were the only
compounds found to be successful and included 40% phenol and a mixture
of 20% phenol and 50% orthocresol. Application was by painting 15-30ml
onto the relevant area. In discussing the effectiveness of these agents, theauthors noted a number of disadvantages arising from the toxic and irritant
properties of phenol and cresol, such as the need to take special precautions
to prevent injury to human operators and increased toxicity to lambs
resulting from excess absorption through intact skin. In Wool TeclmologyalldSlleep Breeding 23 (2) 26-27 (1976) the sameauthors reported the successful use of a 40% phenol emulsion which was
applied to the relevant areas in an amount of 10-20ml using a roll-on
dispenser. In this paper it is stated that the phenol rapidly penetrates the
superficial layers of the skin, destroying cells and paralyzing nerve endings
to produce an almost painless effect, whilst the germicidal nature of the
phenol prevented infection in the healing tissue. Again it is noted that
operators need to observe rigorous safety precautions. Australian patent specification No. 73793/91 describes a non-surgicalmulesing method involving the application of a cationic compound such as ahalogenated quaternary ammonium compound (e. g. didecylmethylamineammoniumchloride), which complexes with glycosaminoglycans present in
the skin to form full skin thickness eschars which are ultimately sloughed to
leave linear scars similar to those resulting from the Mules operation. While
found to be effective in reducing blow-fly strike incidence, the method has
not been widely practised because it appears to cause sheep a similar amount
of pain to that of surgical mulesing. A further disadvantage is the risk of
injury to operators.Accordingly, there remains a need for an effective, non-surgical
mulesing method which is safe in use and causes little or no trauma to the
recipient animals. It is also desired that such a method avoids damage to the
skin which might devalue the hide.Summaryof the Invention:
The present invention provides, in one aspect, a method for the
controlled ablation of wool follicles within skin of a wool bearing animal at
one or more selected localities, comprising;
treating said skin at said selected locality (ies) with a composition
comprising at least one follicle-ablating agent and, subsequently,
irradiating said skin at said selected locality (ies) with electromagnetic
radiation of an intensity and/or wavelength to bring about the photodynamic
ablation of at least a portion of the wool follicles present in the skin at said
selected locality (ies).Detaileddisclosure of the Invention
The invention is hereinafter described in reference to the preferred
treatment of the wool follicles of sheep, although the present invention is
suitable for treatment of the wool follicles of other wool bearing animals such
as goats and alpacas. In a preferred form, the present invention provides a method for the
controlled ablation of wool follicles within skin of sheep at one or more
selected localities, comprising;
treating said skin at said selected locality (ies) with a composition
comprising at least one follicle-ablating agent and, subsequently,
irradiating said skin at said selected locality (ies) with electromagnetic
radiation of an intensity and wavelength to bring about the photodynamic
ablation of at least a portion of the wool follicles present in the skin at said
selected locality (ies). The follicle-ablating agent (s) may be selected from photosensitisers
and substances which induce the formation and/or accumulation of anendogenous photosensitiser (s). Suitable photosensitisers include porphyrin
derivatives and analogues (e. g. haematoporphyrin (HpD) derivatives such as
di-haematoporphyrin ether). It is, however, preferred to use a substance
which induces the formation and/or accumulation of an endogenous
photosensitiser (s). Most preferably, the method comprises treating the skin at said
selected locality (ies) by applying 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) or a
derivative (e. g. esterified 5-AL1\ or 5-ALA conjugated to one or more fatty
acids may show enhanced skin permeability) or analogue thereof. While notwishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that 5-ALA, which is readily
absorbed by the skin, induces the biosynthesis in skin of an excess of
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Accumulated PpIX, when irradiated with
electromagnetic radiation of a photosensitising wavelength (e. g. white light
or broad-spectrum red light), causes phototoxic damage or death (i. e.
ablation) of skin cells including cells of wool follicles. The composition is preferably applied topically or
intradermally/subcutaneously (e. g. by hydraulic or pneumatic applicators). The composition preferably comprises a suitable carrier. For topical
application, the carrier is preferably selected from diethylene glycolmouoethyl ether (DGME) and mixtures including propylene glycol and
glycerol. Other suitable carriers include ethanol and isopropyl myristate. The composition may further comprise one or more chelating agents
(e. g. EDTA and 2,2-dipyridyl) and/or other agent (s) (e. g. chlorophyll and
prooxidants) to augment the effect of the follicle-ablating agents. Prior to application of the composition, the wool at the skin
locality (ies) to be treated may be removed, wholly or in part. Methods for
removing the wool include shearing, close clipping with shears (e. g. to a
residual height of 1-2 mm), defleecing with epidermal growth factor (EGF),
shaving and depilation. Degreasing of the wool and skin at the locality (ies)
to be treated with soap or an alcohol wash is also advisable.Following treatment of the skin with the composition, it is preferred
that a period of time (e. g. within 24 hours) sufficient to allow for the
substantial completion of absorption and metabolism of the follicle-ablating
agent be allowed to pass before being irradiated with electromagnetic
radiation of an intensity and/or wavelength to bring about the photodynamic
ablation of wool follicles. Presently, it is believed that the irradiation should
be conducted between 2 and 15 hours, more preferably between 3 and 10
hours, after treating the skin with the said composition. Irradiation may be conducted using any suitable source of
electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic radiation will be of an
intensity and wavelength to bring about the photodynamic ablation of at least
a portion of the wool follicles by sensitising the absorbed follicle-ablating
agent and/or accumulated exogenous photosensitiser (s). The irradiation may
be conducted using a monochromatic or polychromatic light source.Preferably, the irradiation is conducted using a source of light of wavelengthG00 to 700non at a dose (i. e. intensity) of 100-175 (preferably, 150) J/cm2 and
a fluence rate of less than 150mW/cm2, however, other sources of light may
be used including ambient sunlight. By varying the composition, the method provides for the controlled
ablation of a selected percentage of follicles within the selected locality (ies).Preferably, the method results in the ablation of at least 50%, more preferably
at least 70%, of the follicles within the selected locality (ies). For use with
sheep, it may be preferred that the method results in the ablation of about 70-85% of the wool follicles in the selected locality (ies). The subsequentregrowth provided by the 15-30% viable (i. e. non-ablated or regenerated)
follicles is insufficient for the occurrence of blow-fly strike and provides an
avantage in that it prevents the development of skin cancers which mightotherwise occur if 100% of the follicles were ablated. The development of
skin cancers, however, is not anticipated to be a problem with treatment of
the breech and/or pizzle area of sheep since these areas are substantially
shaded from the sun by the sheep's body.100% ablation of wool follicles in sheep skin may be achieved with a
composition comprising 10-20% (w/w) 5-ALA in a suitable carrier at pH 2.5
(unbuffered) or 4.0. Decreasing the amount of 5-ALA to 5-9% is expected to
reduce the percentage of ablated follicles to 70-85%. Varying the duration and/or intensity of the irradiation used is also
expected to affect the percentage of ablated follicles. For example, with a
composition comprising 10% (w/w) 5-ALA in a suitable carrier at pH 2.5(unbuffered), an irradiation time of about 5 minutes (with white light at an
intensity of 150J/cm2) may be expected to achieve 100% ablation whereas an
irradiation time of about 3 minutes may be expected to achieve 70-85%
ablation. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for nonsurgical mulesing of a sheep, the method comprising;
treating the skin at the breech area of the sheep with a composition
comprising at least one follicle-ablating agent and, subsequently,
irradiating at least a portion of the treated area with electromagnetic
radiation of an intensity and/or wavelength to bring about photodynamic
ablation of at least a portion of said wool follicles in said treated skin. While the invention offers an alternative to the Mules Operation, it
may also be employed for pizzle ringing.Accordingly, in yet a further aspect, the present invention provides a
method for non-surgical pizzle ringing of a sheep, the method comprising;
treating skin at or near the pizzle area of the sheep with a composition
comprising at least one follicle-ablating agent and, subsequently,
irradiating at least a portion of the treated area with electromagnetic
radiation of an intensity and/or wavelength to bring about photodynamic
ablation of at least a portion of said wool follicles in said treated skin.Moreover, the application of the method of the invention is not limited
to the containment of incidence of blow-fly strike and balanitis. That is, the
method may also be used for"wigging", removal or reduction of wool from
areas around the face,"crutching" (to prevent blow-fly strike and dags) and
branding of sheep or other wool bearing animals. The method of the present invention may also be used in conjunction
with other wool treatments. For example, the method may be used as an
adjunct to biological defleecing (e. g. EGF defleecing). The terms"comprise","comprises"and"comprising"as usedthroughout the specification are intended to refer to the inclusion of a stated
step, component or feature or group of steps, components or features with or
without the inclusion of a further step, component or feature or group of
steps, components or features. The invention will hereinafter be further described by way of reference
to the following, non-limiting examples and accompanying figure.Brief description of the accompanying rigures:
Figure 1 provides graphical results discussed in Example 2 hereinafter.The figure shows that in skin samples taken from three sheep, the
concentration of PpIX, a metabolite of 5-ALA thought to cause phototoxic
damage or death to skin cells upon irradiation with electromagnetic radiation
of a photosensitising wavelength, peaked between about 6 and 13 hours after
application of 5-ALA. The results suggest that the optimal time for
irradiation is between about 8 and 10 hours after application of 5-ALA,
however some other, empirical evidence from treated sheep indicates that
these times are effective but that optimal levels in the follicles may be
attained prior to this (e. g. between about 3 and 4 hours).Exainple 1: Ablation of wool follicles in sheepP1 eparation of active agent:5-aminolevulinic acid (6-aminolevulinic acid; 5-amino-4-oxopentanoic
acid) (5-ALA) is combined with any suitable vehicle for topical application
and absorption. Tests on sheep employed a mixture of 20% (w/w) propylene
glycol plus 80% (w/w) commercial sorbolene cream containing 10%
glycerine (glycerol). 5-ALA was tested at 5% (w/w) and 17% (w/w).Pleparatioll of skill surface for treatment:
Skin was prepared for treatment by using a defleecing dose ofepidermalgrowth factor, by shaving or by using a depilating agent such as
thioglycollate. The area was swabbed with 70% ethanol to degrease it and
assist penetration of the cream.Piotody. n cumc treatment:
5-ALA mixture was rubbed into the area briefly by hand and the
animals then left for a period of 3 hours to allow the 5-ALA to be absorbed
and metabolised in the skin and follicles. After 3 hours the treatment area
was irradiated with a white light source (e. g. a modified slide projector)
containing a heat filter. Light, 600-700nm, was administered at a dose of125J/cm2 at a fluence rate of less than 150 mW/cm. In the case of the slide
projector (containing a 300W bulb) the lens was held 10 cm from the skin for
no more than 10 mins. Spray anaesthetic was sometimes applied after the
light was removed.Results:
Following treatment there is some slight localised edema which
persists for about 48 hours. There is some discolouration then crusting of
the skin in the treated area. After 4-5 weeks the skin regains its normal
appearance but wool regrowth is either sparse or non-existent in the treatedarea. Tests with mixtures containing 5% (w/w) and 17% (w/w) 5-ALA were
found to be effective. The treatment appears to be relatively painless with
no side effects or chemical residues in the animal.Example 2: 5-AIS metabolism time profiles in sheep skin samples
Tests were conducted to determine the period of time, following
application of 5-ALA, required to achieve peak concentrations of the 5-ALA
metabolite PpIX in skin. Since this metabolite is believed to cause
phototoxic damage or death to skin cells upon irradiation with
electromagnetic radiation of a photosensitising wavelength, it was reasoned
that more consistent ablation of wool follicles in sheep could be achieved by
irradiating the 5-ALA treated skin at a time when the peak concentration ofPpIX was expected.7'estmethod:
5-ALA was formulated as a 10% (w/w) aqueous solution in 90% (w/w)
DGNIE in the presence of various test compound to measure their
effectiveness in enhancing PpIX formation. These formulations were applied
to clipped, mid-flank skin of several sheep after swabbing with 70% ethanol.Skin biopsies were commenced immediately thereafter using a sterile 0.8cm
human biopsy punch. Samples were taken at 2 hourly intervals for times up
to about 20 hours. Skin samples were immediately frozen in dry ice and
stored at-70°C until processed. Skin samples were then thawed,homogenised in aqueous buffer and PpIX extracted into an acid solution and
then into an organic phase of ethyl acetate. PpIX levels were measured in a
spectrofluorimeter using a set of standards of known PpIX concentration.The excitation wavelength was 430nm and emission was measured at 595nm.Results :
The results of the tests are shown in Figure 1. The formulations used
for the treatment of the three sheep were:
Animal 4347---10%5-ALA,90% DGME
Animal 4365---10% 5-ALA, 90%DOGME,lOmM EDTA
Animal 4468---10%5-ALA, 90% DGME, 20mM 2,2-dipyridyl
The profiles of PpIX formation shown in Figure 1 suggest that the
optimal treatment time (for irradiation with electromagnetic radiation) would
be about 8 to 10 hours after 5-ALA application. A similar conclusion has
been made from PpIX formation profiles obtained using other 5-ALA
formulations (data not ShOW11).DisCUSSioll :
Since obtaining the PpIX formation profiles shown in Figure 1, follicle
-ablation experiments have been conducted on a further 8 sheep using the
formulation: 10% 5-ALA, 90% DGME, 10nom EDTA (applied to close-clippedbreecli), followed 10 to 14 hours later with a 5 minute irradiation. The light
source used for the irradiation was a bank of five 24V-250W tungsten
halogen projector lamps at a distance to yield a dose of about 150J/cm (heat,
and any excess UV, was shielded with a glass panel treated with an infra-red
reflective coating). Initial observations indicated that the treated animals showed a more
consistent level of follicle ablation. Subsequent observations (up to 2 years
after treatment) have generally indicated that animals which are bare in the
treated area 2 months after treatment, remain so permanently.Example 3: Blow-fly strike prevention field trial
In October 1999, a field trial was conducted in Armidale, NSW,
Australia, to assess the effectiveness of the method of the present invention
in preventing blow-fly strike in sheep.Field tiial method:191Merino lambs (4-5 month old ewes and whethers) were divided
into three groups of 6G, 66 and 59 animals per group, with the latter group
serving as an untreated (i. e. control) group. 66 animals were subjected to
conventional, surgical mulesing and the remaining 66 animals were treated
with the method of the present invention, specifically application of a 5ALA formulation (10% (w/w) 5-ALA in 80% (w/w) DGME, 5% (w/w) cineole,
200 mM 2,2-dipyridyl) to the breech area. Prior preparation of the breech
consisted of close-clipping (i. e. so that 1-2 mm of wool remained) andswabbingbriefly with 70% ethanol. Animals were then treated with a 5
minute exposure to a 1000 watt metal halogen light (estimated dose 120J/cn12 at a fluence rate of 150 mW/cm") 10 hours after application of the 5ALA formulation, All animals were left to graze at pasture and were
observed closely during the following seasons which were favourable forblow-fly strike.Results:
Breech-strike results as of 9 May 2000 (a period of 7 months) were as
shown in Table 1.TABLE1:
Animal Group No of animals observed
with breech-strike
Surgically mulesed group 1 (1.5%)
5-ALA treated group5 (7.6%)
Untreated group 19* (28.8%)
*including 5 multiple or repeat strikes.Disctlssiol l :
The results demonstrate that the method of the present invention is
effective in significantly reducing the incidence of breech-strike as compared
to untreated sheep. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the
success of the method of the present invention may, in part, also stem from
an effect on skin structure, vasculature and other organs associated with the
wool follicles in the treated area. Thus, the ablation of sebaceous glands and
skin microvasculature may affect both the ability of wool follicles to
regenerate as well as the likelihood of the skin becoming inflamed and
damaged in wet conditions that normally predispose to, or attract, blow-fly
strike. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous
variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in
the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the
invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to
be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.</txt>
