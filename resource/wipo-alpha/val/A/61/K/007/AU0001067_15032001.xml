This application claims priority to U. S. provisional application serial no. 60/
153,005 filed September 9,1999, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to a non-comedogenic skin care composition that
effectively moisturizes the skin through a combination of the softening effects of
emollients with the moisture retaining action of humectants and coating activities of
lubricants, to counteract the effect of moisture loss, thereby keeping skin soft, smooth
and supple. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
It is known that skin protection and a long lasting moisturizing effect is best
achieved through water-in-oil emulsions. See, for example, U. S. Patent No. 3,818,105.However, such emulsions compromise aesthetics due to their oily and greasy after feel
when applied to the skin. Certain water-based products, i. e., oil-in-water emulsions, are
oil-free and non-greasy but lack sufficient moisturizing properties. U. S. Patent No.4,389,419 discloses a skin care water-out emulsion composition to moisturize and
condition the skin comprising mixture of petrolatum or mineral oil, a quaternary
ammonium emulsifier, a fatty alcohol and a fatty ester emollient. While this
composition counteracts the effect of moisture loss, thereby keeping the skin soft,
smoothe and supple, the presense of petrolatum and mineral oils makes the composition
difficult to emulsify as well as render it cosmetically unacceptable. The problems associated with an effective skin moisturizing product are even
more profound in the teenage market where the mode of moisturizing is seen as
conflicting with keeping skin free of pimples and comedones. Teenagers normally avoid
moisturizers because they are perceived to worsen problematic skin. However, adequate
hydration is necessary for healing and to reduce dryness, thereby, maintaining the
integrity of the skin's barrier function. Accordingly, there remains a need for an effective skin moisturizing composition
that is effective at moisturizing the skin without the leaving an oily or greasy feel to the
skin and is non-comedogenic. It has surprisingly been discovered that a light, oil-free, non-greasy, water based
cream emulsion, that is easy to spread, quick absorbing, long lasting, and noncomedogenic can be obtained through a specific combination of emollients, humectants
and keratolytic agent. SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Accordingly, the invention relates to an oil-free skin care composition for
moisturizing the skin comprising:
(a) a humectant comprising glycerin and propylene glycol;
(b) an emollient comprising isohexadecane, cylcomethicone,
dimethicone, dimethicone copolyol and trimethylsiloxysilicate;
(c) a keratolytic agent; and
(d) water. The skin care compositions according to the invention accomplish effective
moisturization through a combination of the softening effects of emollients with the
moisture retaining action of humectants and coating activities of lubricants. The
combination of ingredients counteract the effect of moisture loss, thereby keeping skin
soft, smooth and supple. The compositions according to the invention are noncomedogenic and have long lasting moisturizing effects without the use of occlusive
materials. DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The invention relates to a skin care composition for moisturizing the skin
comprising a humectant, an emollient, a keratolytic agent and water. The skin care
composition according to the invention is an oil-free, water-based, i. e., oil-in-water
emulsion. In the context of the invention, the phrase"oil-free"means free from
petrolatum or any ingredient with the name"oil"in its nomenclature, including, for
example, mineral oil. The skin care compositions according to the invention comprise at least one
humectant which increases the water content of the top layer of the skin by actively
attracting and retaining the moisture where it is needed to relieve dry skin. The skin's
moisture level is thereby increased without feeling heavy and occlusive. The humectant is preferably present in an amount of from about 2 to about 10 wt.%, based on the total composition. Suitable humectants for use in the present invention
include glycerin, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. In a particularly preferred
embodiment, the humectant is a mixture of from about 1 to about 5 wt. % of glycerin and
from about 1 to about 5 wt. % of propylene glycol, even more preferably, from about 2
to about 3 wt. % glycerin and from about 2 to about 3 wt. % propylene glycol, based on
the total composition. The skin care composition according to the invention also contain an emollient.The emollient useful in the skin care composition according to the invention contains a
mixture of isohexadecane, cyclomethicone, dimethicone, dimethicone copolyol, and
trimethylsiloxysilicate. The emollients act indirectly to soften the stratum corneum by
slowing down the loss of moisture to the environment, allowing the skin to remoisturize itself from within. The dimethicone and trimethylsiloxysilicate offers skin protection and long
lasting lubricity with a light touch and do not interfere with the skin's transpiration. The
combination of cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol is normally used for preparing
water-in-cyclomethicone emulsions. In the skin care compositions according to the
invention, the cylcomethicone and dimethicone copolyol is used as a delivery system for
the emollients. Being a water-based emulsion, i. e., oil-in-water, once applied to the skin,
the volatile components evaporate, imparting a cooling effect on the skin as well as
leaving behind the heavier, more effective skin conditioning agents on the skin. In addition to providing emolliency, the dimethicone copolyol is a silicone glycol
copolymer that provides humectant benefits in addition to emolliency. Examples of
commercially available dimethicone copolyols useful herein sold by Dow Corning
Corporation are DC 190, DC 193, DC Q2-5220, DC 2501 Wax, DC 2-5324 fluid, and
DC 3225C (this later material being sold as a mixture with cyclomethicone). Cetyl
dimethicone copolyol is commercially available as a mixture with polyglyceryl-4
isostearate (and) hexyl laurate and is sold under the tradename ABIL. RTM. WE-09
(available from Goldschmidt). Trimethylsiloxysilicate is a polymeric material corresponding to the general
chemical formula [(CH2) 3 SiO"2] X [SiO2] y wherein x is an integer from about 1 to about
500 and y is an integer from about 1 to about 500. A preferred commercially available
trimethylsiloxysilicate is sold by Dow Corning as a mixture with dimethicone as DC
593. Suitable dimethicones useful as an emollient in the skin care composition of the
invention are commercially available from Dow Corning as the Dow Corning 200 series.A particularly preferred dimethicone for use in the skin care compositions of the
invention is available from Dow Corning is DC200/350cst. In a preferred embodiment, the skin care composition according to the invention
comprises from about 3 t about 15 wt. % of the emollient. Particularly preferred is a
combination of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 wt. % isohexadecane, from about 1.0 to about
5.0 wt. % of DC 3225C, and from about 0.5 to about 3.0 wt. % of DC 593 and from
about 0.5 to about 3.0 DC 200/350 wt. % cst based on the total weight of the
composition. The keratolytic agent useful in the skin care compositions according to the
invention should be effective in preventing pimples and comodones. Suitable keratolytic
agents include alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids. The most preferred
keratolytic agent is salicylic acid. Preferably, the keratolytic agent is present in the skin
care compositions according to the invention at from about 0.25 to about 2.0 wt. %, more
preferably from about 0.5 to about 2.0 wt. %, based on the total composition. The skin care composition according to the invention preferably contains an
effective stabilizing amount of an emulsifier. Preferably, the emulsifier is present at
from about 1.0 to about 10.0, more preferably from about 3.0 to about 6.0, weight
percent, based on the total composition. Any emulsifier that is compatible with the
components of the composition can be employed. However, it has been discovered that
when stearic acid is the primary emulsifier, it also helps provide the skin feel of the
product. Additionally, when used as co-emulsifiers, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol
also provide lubricating properties for the skin. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment,
the emulsifier used in the skin care composition of the invention is a mixture of from
about 0.5 to about 3.0, more preferably form about 1 to about 2, weight percent, based
on the total composition, each of stearic acid, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. The emulsion can be further stabilized by inclusion of a small quantity of a
thickener. The thickener is used in amount of about 0.01 to about 10% by weight based
upon the weight of the coating composition. The range of about 0.01 to about 5% by
weight is preferred, with the range of about 0.03 to about 1.0% by weight being
particularly preferred. The thickener can be a non-associative thickener or stabilizer,
such as a homopolymer or a copolymer of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid or
anhydride monomers containing at least one activated carbon to carbon olefinic double
bond and at least one carboxyl group or an alkali soluble acrylic emulsion.Alternatively, an associative thickener or stabilizer can be used, such as a
hydrophobically modified alkali soluble acrylic emulsion or a hydrophobically modified
nonionic polyol polymer, i. e., a hydrophobically modified urethane polymer, or
combinations thereof. The copolymers are preferably copolymers of a polycarboxylic
acid monomer and a hydrophobic monomer. The preferred carboxylic acid is acrylic
acid. The homopolymers and copolymers preferably are crosslinked. Homopolymers of polyacrylic acid are described, for example, in U. S. Pat. No.2,798,053, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of
homopolymers which are useful include Carbopol Registered TM 934,940,941, Ultrez
10, ETD 2050, and 974P polymers, which are available from The B. F. Goodrich
Company. Such polymers are homopolymers of unsaturated, polymerizable carboxylic
monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, maleic
anhydride, and the like. Hydrophobically modified polyacrylic acid polymers are described, for
example, in U. S. Pat. Nos. and 5,349,030, the disclosures of which are herein
incorporated by reference. These polymers have a large water-loving hydrophilic
portion (the polyacrylic acid portion) and a smaller oil-loving hydrophobic portion
(which can be derived from a long carbon chain acrylate ester). Representative higher
alkyl acrylic esters are decycl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, behenyl acrylate
and melissyl acrylate, and the corresponding methacrylates. It should be understood that
more than one carboxylic monomer and more than one acrylate ester or vinyl ester or
ether or styrenic can be used in the monomer charge. The polymers can be dispersed in
water and neutralized with base to thicken the aqueous composition, form a gel, or
emulsify or suspend a deliverable. Useful polymers are sold as Carbopol Registered TM
1342 and 1382 and Pemulen Registered TM TR-1, TR-2,1621, and 1622, all available
from BFGoodrich. Particularly preferred is Pemulen TR-1 (CTFA Designation:Acrylates/10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer). Neutralizing agents suitable for use in neutralizing acidic group containing
hydrophilic gelling agents herein include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
ammonium hydroxide, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The skin care compositions according to the invention preferably has a pH which
provides a suitable environment for the keratolytic agent efficacy as well as to maintain
the skin's moisture balance where the pH is in the range of 4.5 to 6.5. Preferably, the pH
of the composition ranges from 5.5 to 6.5. Generally, the water content of the skin care compositions according to the
invention ranges from about 75 to about 85 wt. %, preferably from about 75 to about 80
wt. % water. This relatively high water content makes the cream light and easy to apply.The compositions are preferably formulated so as to have a product viscosity of from
about 75,000 to about 300,000 cps. The skin care compositions according to the invention can comprise additional
ingredients commonly found in skin care compositions, such as for example,
preservatives, antioxidants, perfumes, chelating agents, etc., provided that they are
physically and chemically compatible with the other components of the composition.Examples of suitable preservatives for use in the skin care compositions of the invention
include the Cl-C4 alkyl parabens and phenoxyethanol. Generally, the preservative is
present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 2.0, preferably about 1.0 to about
1.5, weight percent based on the total composition. In a preferred embodiment, the
preservative is mixture of from about 0.2 to about 0.5 weight percent methylparaben,
from about 0.2 to about 5.0 weight percent propylparaben and from about 0.05 to about
0.10 weight percent butylparaben. A particularly preferred commercially available
preservative that may be used in the skin care composition according to this invention is
PHENONIP TM which is a practically colorless, viscous, liquid mixture of
phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben
available from Nipa Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, Del. Preferably, an oil-soluble antioxidant should be present in the skin care
compositions according to the invention. Suitable antioxidants include butylated
hydroxy toluene (BHT), ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroanisole (BHA), phenyl-anaphthylamine, hydroquinone, propyl gallate, nordihydroquiaretic acid, and mixtures
thereof. Preferably the antioxidant is BHT and is present in the composition at from about
. 02 to about. 05wt%, most preferably from about. 02 to about 0.10. Fragrances suitable for use in the skin care compositions according to the invention
are well known in the art. Particularly preferred are those that can provide a fruity and/or
floral fragrance, such as, for example, Mod Twist, commercially available from Haarmann
Reimer Corp. In certain aspects of this invention, the compositions should include a chelating
agent. Chelating agents which are useful in the compositions of the present invention
include ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and derivatives and salts thereof,
dihydroxyethyl glycine, citric acid, tartaric acid, and mixtures thereof. The chelating
agents should be utilized in a stabilizing effective amount and may range from about
0.01 to about 2% based on the weight of the total composition, preferably from about
0.05 to about 1%. Most preferably, the chelating agent should be EDTA. Other ingredients may include agents which assist in protecting the skin from
aging, such as sunscreens, anti-oxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid, vitamin B, biotin,
pantothenic acid, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin C, and sodium bisulfite. Yeast
extract, gingko biloba, bisabolol, panthenol, alpha hydroxy acids and oligosaccharides
such as melibiose are among other ingredients which assist in preventing aging of the
skin by such means as irritation mitigation, oxidation mitigation, healing, affecting
retinoid metabolism and inhibiting the production of elastase. Ingredients with a low comedogenicity capacity should be chosen in order to
render the product non-comedogenic. The skin care compositions according to the invention accomplish effective
moisturization through a combination of the softening effects of emollients with the
moisture retaining action of humectants and coating activities of lubricants, to counteract
the effect of moisture loss, thereby keeping skin soft, smooth and supple. The
compositions according to the invention have long lasting moisturizing effects without
the use of occlusive materials. The compositions of the present invention can be prepared by well-known
mixing or blending procedures. Each phase of the emulsion is preferably separately
prepared with all of the components contained in the appropriate phase, except that it is
usually preferred to omit the retinoid compound initially. The emulsion is then formed
normally by adding the oil phase to the water phase with agitation, and the emulsion
should be cooled down when the retinoid compound is added. Set forth below is an
example of a preferred method for preparing the skin care composition according to the
invention. Salicylic Acid (premix 1):
