<ab xml:lang="EN">A method of creating solid alum salt-based products in a liquid dispensing container so that precise doses of alum salts may interface with water; forming useful commercial products with a far superior life span in the medicinal and personal care industries. Central to the invention is being able to form products that last up to 10 times longer than other products resulting in millions of tons less plastic wastage in the environment.

<txt xml:lang="EN"> SOLID ALUM SALT-BASED PRODUCTS IN A LIQUID DISPENSING CONTAINER
Description
Just add water product technology: A crystal of mineral salts is grown in a pump mist
spray bottle.The crystal forms as a solid in the bottom of the bottle. when water is added this will
dissolve a small amount of the minerals into the water creating a product that can be
used for treatment of mouth ulcers (canker sores), cold sores, skin rashes like
dermatitis, psoriasis, tinea, as a blood stop, for suture wound and umbilical care. infirstaidapplicationsforcutsbumsorabrasions.Marinestings,insectbites,Sun

when the bottle is empty of spray you simply re fill it with water and it makes more
product instantly. We can make products that refill 5,10, or twenty times so its like
20 bottles of product in one. This also creates an new system of environmental grade
1 products, because it reduces the amount of waste plastic bottles entering theenvironment as land fill. Its twenty times less use of power resources to produce the
product and twenty times less consumption and greenhouse effect upon theenvironment. Background History and Art. Alum is an inorganic compound and generally contais two metals two sulfate groups and
water. A compound of this type is called a hydrate Double salt. Alum's included liydrated
double salts That have similar compositions and similar crystalline structures. The
description of alum also includes Aluminum Sulfate, Aluminum Chlorohydrate and
Aluminum chlorydroxide. Alum's have a variety of uses. For instance Alum's have been used in the dying industry,
for water purification, for paper sizing, for fire proofing fabrics, in fire extinguishers, and
in medicinal and cosmetics fields. It is the medicinal and cosmetics fields where alum's have particularinterest. For instance
alum has astringent properties, and is used in medicine to treat certain skin conditions, and
to stop bleeding from small cuts. dilute solutions (1-4%) have been used as mouth washes
and gargles. solutions of 5-10 % are used to harden the skin. especially of the feet Strong
aqueous solutions of alum are used as styptic for minor cuts and abrasions. Recent
applications of alum containing solutions include bladder irrigation's for hemorrhaging
Alum is an important chemical compound with great benefits across a broad specum of
issues to mankind.
commercially alum's include Aluminum Sulfate, potassium alum and ammonium alum and
include all alum based salt
Sulfate groups known to science as alum based sulfates. Ammonium alum is manufactured
by Crystallization from an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate and aluminum sulfate. Ammonium alum crystals are also produced by treating a mixture of aluminum sulfate and
sulfurie acid with ammonia. Potassium alum occurs naturally in the mineras alunite and
kalinite. It is known that alum's, Alum sulfate and especially potassium and ammonium alum can
be used as a deodorant for human use in liquid form. The alum salts are highly dissolvable
in water. To make an effective solution, 5-10 % by volume weight of alum may be
added. If to much of the alum salts are added to a liquid medium it results in an over
saturation of suspended salts which presents the following problems. pump spray bottlesbecome blocked and clogged with salt crystals in the spray head and the pump spray tube.Plior Art
It is known that alum salts may be plasticized with additives such as Art work disclosed in
Patent no 693744 in Australia entitled A moldable Alum Composition (The Invention Of
this Author)0
This Patent relates to forming Alum solids that are demolded for use. Not to alum solids
that are dissolved by water the subject of this Technology.Technical object
It is the object of this invention to create an Alum based end product that can be refilled
with water to dissolve in precise saturation doses so that it does not block up the spray
pump head and to form a product that can be conveniently refilled by consumers with
water to make more product instantly. To over come the suspension saturation problem it has been discovered that the solid
alum salts solution strength and rate may be controlled by direct volumetric exposure to
a liquid in a dispensing container. The diagram marked as figure 1 is used to highlight
the method. in the diagram the bottle has a solid of alum crystal in the bottom. The side
walls and bottom of the alum are sealed tight against the walls and are not exposed to
the water, only the top surface area of the alum is dissolved. The water reaches
saturation point and can not dissolve any more alum. Figure 2 is a capitale devise that
may be filled with Alum and the dropped into the bottle for dispersion of Alum and
additives. METHOD 1
Heat 500 grams of granulated Alum at 100 c add 10 grams of glycerin. When the alum
lias mclted into a'liquid or is substantially liquid it is then poured into a pre determined
liquid dispensing container. (Packaging) The hot liquid alum solidifies upon cooling
forming a three dimensional shape with one face exposed to form a saturated solution
when water is added. The side walls and bottom of the Alum compound is sealed to the
water being added so that over ionization and solution saturation cannot occur as disclosed
in the Non commercial example.METHOD 2
Heat 500 grams of Alum in a 1000 watt micro wave on high for 15 minutes. Add 25
grams of glycerin. When finished cooking bring out of the micro wave and re hydrate byadding water back to 480 grams. Allow to cool to 50 degrees C and place into bottle or
captule container where the Alum mixture will recrystalise into a solid.METHOD 3
Follow method 1 but do not add any additives, allow to cool but still liquid and pour into containment
devise.The above Methods detail various formula's with or without additives, if additives are desired they may be
added n'om.OSpercent to 50 % by weight of alum.
it can be seen by using the above describedmethods that a refillable with water product is made for use in
the cosmetics, medicinal and veterinary industries. Non Commercial Examples
If Alum compounds or granules of alum compounds are placed into a liquid pump spray,
when water is added this will result in an over saturation of the dissolved salts and block
and clog up the spray head as per figure 3
The combine surface area of the alum granules interacting with the liquid results in
super saturated solution that will block and clog the spray pump head and tube. It seems(withoutwishing to be bound by theory) That an over ionization process occurs of the
base water acting upon the positive electrons on the acidity of the Alum Salts. This leads
to small crystals and granules of the alum dropping out of the solution and settling in the
container which are sucked up the spray head tube and blocking it. even if filters etc. are
placed on the spray tube preventing these granules entering the tube the solution is far to
strong and causes the spray top to become blocked and clogged. COMPOUND CLAIMED : The Alum Group Of Compounds
The Group Of Alum's claimed are any of the water soluble alum's which may be melted
by heat and solidified in liquid dispensing devises. Aluminum Sulfate, ammonium alum,
potassium alum or any alum based compounds that create the same effect and end use
products of water solubility and refill technology the subject of this invention. Claimed Additives
