TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention provides a method and a system for obtaining
demographic information about network users, particularly, but not exclusively,
users of public access networks such as the internet.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
There are currently many internet products which provide platforms for
displaying notices, advertisements or promotions to internet users. Some products
encourage use by providing one or more free services, such as an email account.Advertising and promotions are commonly distributed indiscriminately over the internet
without regard to the demographic profile of each user since a reliable source of such
information can be difficult to obtain. Demographic profile information may include,
but is not limited to, information about each user's age, sex, employment, education,
income, interests, or purpose for using the internet. However, internet users are
understandably hesitant to divulge this type of information as it is of a private nature.There is therefore a need for methods and systems which encourage internet users to
willingly divulge at least some types of demographic profile information. A significant problem faced by internet users is how to find topics and web
pages that will interest them. Internet users currently use search engines and survey
pages in order to locate areas of the internet that may be useful and relevant. However,
search engines are notoriously difficult to use as a given search request may return
thousands of hits according to the complexities of the search-ranking system. Survey
pages may be commercially biased, out of date or incomplete. Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word"comprise"or variations such as"comprises"or"comprising", will be understood to
imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but
not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
A first aspect of the invention provides a system for providing profile
information about at least one internet user, the system comprising:-at least one receiving means for receiving internet usage information and
registration information about each of the at least one internet users;-a profile generating means for generating a profile data set for each of
the at least one internet users from the registration information and
internet usage information;-an information providing means for providing at least one party with
profile information obtained from at least one profile data set, wherein
the at least one party includes each of the at least one internet users. A second aspect of the invention is a method of providing profile information
about at least one internet user, the method comprising the steps of:
-receiving registration information from each of the at least one internet
users;
-receiving internet usage information about each of the at least one
internet users;
-generating a profile data set for each user from the registration
information and internet usage information;
-providing at least one party with profile information obtained from at
least one profile data set, wherein the at least one party includes each of
the at least one internet users. The at least one party may further comprise a third party in addition to the users.The present invention has the advantage of offering each user summary demographic
information about the surfing habits and interests of other users who have also
registered, thereby giving each user an incentive to supply their registration and internet
usage information. The profile information may be used by a user to view their own
web-surfing habits, and may allow the surfing habits of particular demographic groups
of a site or set of web sites to be examined. For example, parents may use the profile
information to monitor the internet usage of children. Preferably, profile information
provided to any party is presented as summarised demographic information about a
selection of users, rather than personal details about any single user. For example, the
profile information may be presented in a statistical format. However, a user may be
given access to their own personal details. Although the internet provides a vast repository of information, a user of the
internet is frequently faced with the challenge of filtering out masses of irrelevant
information in order to locate a small amount of useful information. The profile
information provided to users may include the sites or links used by other users with the
same demographic profile and interests and can therefore speed up a user's search for
information about a particular topic. For example, a user may use the profile
information to assist in answering questions such as,"what are the most popular web
sites relating to the topic of computer programming which are frequented by people
with the same demographic background as myself?"
Registration information may be voluntarily supplied by a user and may include
personal details about the user, such as age, sex, employment history, income level,
geographical location, interests, educational background, or family makeup. The
registration information may be provided in conjunction with downloading a new
software product. The registration information may alternatively be provided via a
warranty card filled out by a user after the purchase of a new product, or via a survey
form. The internet usage information may be a record of an internet site visited by a
user. Preferably, the internet usage information comprises a record of each hyperlink
clicked on by a user when using a particular web browser. The internet usage
information may provide detailed information on web usage patterns both between and
within web sites. Preferably, the user should explicitly approve that the registration information
and internet usage information will become part of profile information about the user,
and that at least part of the information may be conveyed to other parties. All profile
information should be collected and handled in accordance with any local laws. Proofof-age checks may be enforced before accepting registration information from a user. All registration and internet usage information should only be used for legal purposes. Preferably, a privacy policy concerning the handling of profile information is formed,
and each user may be told about the privacy policy before registering and during data
collection. Preferably, there is further provided a certification party which checks the
security, integrity, and privacy of the system to ensure that laws are not breached. The system may also include an information limiting means for each user to
individually limit the type and quantity of their own registration and internet usage
information reported to the at least one receiving means. The type and quantity of
profile information provided to each user may be related to the type and quantity of
internet usage information or registration reported to the at least one receiving means.For example, if a user decides to stop the receiving means from receiving their internet
usage information, the user in turn may be restricted from examining summary
demographic information about other users during this time. In one embodiment, the
system provides a number of different information reporting levels to the user in return
for the user providing more or less profile information about themselves. In another
embodiment, a user can choose to progressively report further registration information
or internet usage information in return for progressively receiving more advanced
querying, searching and access to the demographic information of other users. A user
may therefore keep control of the amount of information provided, and gradually
provide more information when they feel comfortable to do so. The at least one receiving means may comprise a first receiving means for
receiving the registration information, and a second receiving means for receiving the
internet usage information. The registration information, internet usage information,
and profile data set may be stored on one or more storage means. Profile information provided to a third party may be different to profile
information provided to each user, although both sets of information would be obtained
from the same profile data. The profile information provided to a third party may
comprise demographic information derived purely from the registration information.The profile information may also comprise the internet usage information. Profile
information may be provided to the third party in return for some form of payment. For
example, an advertiser might use the profile information to direct advertising to users
who are more likely to be interested in the contents of the advertising based on their
demographic profile or internet usage habits. The profile information can thus be used
to avoid indiscriminate distribution of advertising or promotions, or so-called"spamming". In another example, computer programmers may use the profile
information to examine which sites relating to programming are popular in the context
of the surfing habits of the other registered programmers. The profile information may also be used by a third party to develop a more
comprehensive picture of the web surfing patterns and interests of the users. The
profile information may also be used to assess the interests of a particular demographic
with respect to different subject matter: the web pages which are looked at by users;
how long the users spend on each web page; the links users use to navigate the web site;
or the demographic profiles of users who read a given web page. It will be understood
that the profile information may be used to determine many other types of web site
performance characteristics. Such information is extremely valuable to web site
designers as it allows them to tailor a web site structure to maximise its effectiveness
and attractiveness to one or more demographics that correspond to the customer profiles
of an organisation. For example, a web site may be altered to attract web users with a
particular demographic profile, or to enhance the exposure of particular web site
features. Any subsequent alterations to a web site could be objectively tested by
examining profile information acquired after the alterations were made. The profile information provided to a user may be limited to profile information
obtained from the user's own profile data. For example, profile information may
consist of a record of all internet sites visited by the user in a given time period. Each
user may also be given the option of being provided with profile information about
other users. For example, the profile information provided to each of the users may
show the internet usage habits of users matching a demographic profile specified by a
user. Thus, at least some embodiments of the present invention have the advantage that
internet users can be encouraged to provide personal information in return for receiving
profile information about themselves and/or other users, while the profile information
can also be used by a third party for commercial purposes. The information providing means may comprise one or more searching facilities
for searching through the profile information based on at least one predetermined
selection criterion. Information may be provided in the form of a report. Examples of
reports generated in response to a search request include:
-most visited sites for given user demographic profile;
-user demographic profiles associated with a set of given sites;
-web sites most visited by the users;
-web links most visited by the users;-a list of the most popular web sites related to a particular topic;
-most effective links that take users to other web sites;
-web sites most bookmarked by the users;
-web sites giving the most return visits by the users;
-most popular keywords associated with a given demographic profile;
-user keywords associated with most used links;
-most popular forms;
-time spent by users in sites;
-number of links clicked on by users in a given site;
-pages spent the most time on by users; or
-a clustering report-which products a user having a given demographic
profile is interested in, and which products the user is not interested in. The searching facility allows each user to limit the scope of the profile
information provided and to isolate information which is of particular interest. The
profile information may be provided in a range of different forms, including a
summarised form, an aggregated form, or raw data extracted from the profile data. Any
means of presenting data may be used when providing profile information to a party,
including: graphical, such as charts, graphs, drawings, or maps; textual, such as
spreadsheets, reports, lists, or tables; or multimedia. When the registration information of a user is received, the profile generating
means may associate the information with a unique client identifier. Any subsequent
information received from the user, such as internet usage information, is preferably
accompanied with the client identifier in order to link the internet usage information
with the registration information. The internet usage information may be used in conjunction with the registration
information for the purpose of developing detailed marketing information, which can
then be retailed to another party such as a marketing or advertising company. The internet usage information may be generated by known web browsers which
keep a"history"file with URLs of web sites visited. Alternatively, the invention may
further comprise a collection means for collecting internet usage information from a
user, and for sending the internet usage information to the second receiving means. The
collection means may be a computer program operating in tandem with a user's web
browser. The collection means may send each piece of internet usage information
directly to the second receiving means as it is collected. Alternatively, the collection
means may store batches of internet usage information and periodically send the batches
to the second receiving means. The storage means for storing each profile may store the profiles on a computer
readable medium, and may include a computer database. The information providing
means may comprise any means of dispensing information. The information providing
means may comprise an online computer server suitable for providing information over
the internet, but may be provided in print or other media. Since the profile information
available to users and a third party may be different, the information providing means
may comprise an information processing means for determining the type and volume of
information to be provided to each party. For example, it may not be appropriate to
provide certain aspects of the profile information to a third party. Furthermore, each
party may only require specific aspects of the profile information, depending on the
application. The information providing means may comprise a first information providing
means and a second information providing means. There may also be one or more
additional information providing means. For example, a first information providing
means may comprise a web-based server for use by internet users, while a second
information providing means may comprise a mailout facility for mailing out specific
aspects of the user profile information in response to a request by another party. One
embodiment of an information providing means comprises a mailout facility which only
provides information to third parties in response to requests for specific information.The mailout facility may enable third parties to be charged according to the type and
volume of profile information provided. The mailout facility may employ any form of
communication, such as an internet connection, email, telephone, telex, or nonelectronic mail. The information providing means may comprise a history display means for
displaying each of the web sites visited by a user (the so-called"navigation history")
over a predetermined period of time. Preferably, the history display means is arranged
such that each internet user is only able to view their own navigation history. However,
the navigation histories of at least one of the users may be provided to a third party. The history display device may provide a visual picture of the navigation history of a
user. The visual picture may be displayed in a web map format. Such a display device
provides the user with a"cyber-atlas"of their internet travels and may make it easier to
understand how one idea led to another, or to backtrack at a later date. The history
display device may provide a visual picture in a two-dimensional format and/or a threedimensional format. A web map displayed by the history display device may include
nodes which are each a graphical representation of either a web site or an object visited
in a web site. A node may be hyperlinked to an object represented by the node. This
would enable a user to easily return to a site visited earlier by simply clicking on the
appropriate hyperlinked node in the web map. The history display device may obtain
data for the navigation history from a history file generated by a web browser. The
history display device may be offered as a free service to users, and provides an
incentive for users to divulge registration information and internet usage information. The system may further comprise a third receiving means for receiving
miscellaneous additional information or communications reported from each user. The
communications or additional information may relate to one or more of the following:
-a request for help or problem-solving tips;
-an order for a product or service; or
-a comment on a web site visited by a user; or
-a vote in an election or poll. The client identifier may be assigned to any communications or additional
information reported by a user and added to the appropriate profile data. Preferably,
the client identifier is assigned by the collection means (where it is provided). Once a
user's communications or additional information are added to the appropriate profile
data, other parties may have access to at least part of the communications or additional
information via the profile information. For example, each of the users may be
provided with comments from one of the users, such as comments about a web site. The
information providing means may provide a forum in which users'comments about
web sites can be accessed by each of the users. In another example, the information
providing means may provide the results of an election or poll held for the users. The
election or poll results may include a demographic breakdown of trends in the results. Such information may also be provided to a third party. All information provided to
users by the information providing means may be presented in either graphical, textual,
or multimedia formats, or a combination of two or more of these. Profile information may be provided to each party as a result of executing a
computer program, function or routine which communicates with the information
providing means through an application programming interface (API). Similarly, the
internet usage information and registration information may be collected by executing a
computer program, function or routine which communicates with the at least one
receiving means through an API. Further, the navigation history may be displayed by
executing a computer program, function or routine which communicates with the
history display means through an API. Furthermore, profile information may be
generated by executing a computer program, function or routine which communicates
with the profile generating means. A third aspect of the invention provides a computer readable medium storing
instructions for controlling at least one computing device to provide profile information
about at least one internet user in accordance with the method of the first aspect of the
present invention. A fourth aspect of the invention provides a display system including means for
graphically displaying a navigation history of an internet user. The display system may
construct a visual display of the navigation history using history data provided by a web
browser. Alternatively, the system may construct a visual display of the navigation
history using data provided from an external source, such as the information providing
means provided by the first aspect of the invention. The display system may provide a
graphic computer display with one or more windows. Web pages or web sites visited
by the user may be represented in a web map on the graphic computer display as nodes
in the form of icons or shapes. Hyperlinks clicked on by a user may be represented in
the graphic display by lines between representations of linked web objects. Arrowheads
on the lines may be used to indicate the direction of travel between web objects.Predetermined nodes may be emphasised in the web map. For example, a node
representing a web site or web page may be emphasised by making it larger than other
nodes in the web map, or by using an icon which changes colour and/or shape. A node
may be emphasised in response to a request from a third party, such as an owner of a
web site corresponding to the node. The node may be emphasised in return for some
form of payment from the third party. In another embodiment, the display system constructs a graphic computer
display comprising a bookmark filing system. A bookmark in a web browser is a record
of a web site address which can be used to link directly to the web site of interest. The
bookmark filing system may include an information tree with a range of categories of
interest and sub-categories of interest arranged in a tree structure. A user may assign
one or more bookmarks to selected categories or sub-categories in the tree. The navigation history may be displayed by executing a third party program,
function or routine which communicates with the display system through an application
programming interface. A fifth aspect of the invention provides a computer readable medium storing
instructions for controlling a computing device to graphically display a navigation
history of an internet user. In order that the present invention may be more clearly understood,
embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the
accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the flow of information in an embodiment of
a system according to the present invention. Fig. 2 is a first embodiment of the user system shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a second embodiment of the user system shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method according to the present
invention. Fig. 5 shows an example of a navigation history graphic display.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
An embodiment of a system and a method for collecting profile information
about a plurality of internet users, and providing the at least some of the information to
the users and to at least one third party will now be described with reference to Figures1 to 5. The first step 10 of the method occurs when an internet user submits
predetermined registration information 20 to a receiving means of a second party. In
this example, the receiving means includes a first data port 40. The first data port 40
may be any type of communications channel, including one or more of the following: an
internet connection; email; facsimile; telex; telephone, or non-electronic mail. A user
might be given the option of submitting the registration information 20 when
purchasing a new product, downloading new software, or accessing a particular web site
or web object. A person skilled in the art will understand that there may be many other
situations in which an internet user may be given the opportunity of submitting
registration information. The registration information would be provided in answer to a
questionnaire on a registration or survey form. The questionnaire may request personal
data about the user relating to topics such as their age, sex, employment history, income
level, geographical location, interests, educational background, or family makeup. It
will be understood that many other types of information about the user may be
requested. Once a user's registration information is received by the second party 30 via the
first data port 40, a second step 45 of the method comprises passing the information 20
to a profile generating means 50 where a file is created for the information. The profile
generating means 50 also assigns a client identifier to the file. The file is then stored on
a database 60. From this point, all information or communications sent by a user should
be accompanied by the user's client identifier, enabling it to be associated with any
information provided earlier, such as registration information. In order to begin
receiving internet usage information, the user should acquire a collection mean, which
in this example is software 70 for collecting information, and is supplied by the second
party. The software 70 may be downloaded from a predetermined web site or may be
automatically downloaded in the form of a browser plugin or Java program. The
software 70 for collecting information is stored on a user's PC 80 and is designed to
record at least part of the operation of a web browser 90 also stored on the PC 80. In
this embodiment, the collection software 70 collects information about which links the
user has clicked on and which sites the user has visited by the web browser 90, and
sends this"history"data 85 (item by item or in batches) over the internet together with
the appropriate client identifier to a second data port 100 (third method step 110). The
history data 85 is then added to the user's registration information 20 in the fourth
method step 120 by the profile generating means 50, and stored as raw profile data on
the database 60 in the fifth step 130. The raw profile data is then processed by a data processing unit 140. The data
processing unit 140 may be used to prepare the data in order to present it in a particular
format, and to limit the type and quantity of information provided, depending on the
party receiving the data. For example, the data processing unit 140 could be a software
program instructed to limit the amount of personal user information released in order to
protect the privacy and security of each user. In another example, the data processing
unit 140 searches through the raw profile data on the database 60 and presents specific
information in response to a search request from a user or a request for information
from a third party 150. User-generated requests 155 for information can be sent from
the collection software 70 and sent to the data processing 140 unit via a third data port
160. The collection software 70 automatically labels the user-generated request 155
with the user's client identifier so that the data processing unit 140 can send the
appropriate information back to the correct user. Information is sent in a sixth step 170
from the second party 30 to each user's PC 80 by a computer server 180 which receives
processed data from the data processing unit 140. The server can also be used to send
information to the third party 150, but alternative communication channels could also be
used. For example, data supplied by the data processing unit 140 may be mailed
directly by email or non-electronic mail to the third party 150. A first embodiment of a portion of the user's PC 80 is shown in Figure 2. A
user's history data 85 generated by a web browser 90 is collected by the collection
software 70, which periodically sends a first stream of history data 85 to the second data
port 100, and a second stream of history data 190 to a history processing means 200.The collection software 70 transmits user-generated requests via a third data stream 155.The history processing means 200 processes the history data 85 and prepares it for
presentation on a graphic display means 210, such as the screen on a computer display.Profile information about the user and other users is received through a data input
channel 215 by an information receiving means 220 from the server 180, and also sent
to the graphic display means 210. In a second embodiment of a user's PC 80 (Figure 3),
the display means 210 receives all data input from the server 180 via the information
receiving means 220, rather than directly from the information collection means 70.The first embodiment (Figure 3) includes a history processing means 200, while the
second embodiment (Figure 4) has no such facility. The second embodiment receives
all data pre-processed by the centrally-located data processing unit 140 of the second
party 30. In both embodiments of the user's PC 80, history data is processed to provide a
history map of a user's internet travels. An example of a history map 230 displayed on
a graphic display means 210 is shown in Figure 5. The graphic display means 210 may
comprise a computer screen, or one of a plurality of windows on a computer screen. Each node 240 represented by a letter A, B, C,... N is the name of a web page visited by
the user, and each arrow 250 shows web links which were taken between each web
page. The direction of each link is shown with arrowheads 260. The number of
arrowheads on a link indicates the number of times that link has been followed. For
example, the user has linked between nodes G and M three times. It can also be seen
that the user started at node A, travelled to B, and then to C, but linked back to B before
linking to D. Each web page represented in the history map 230 is hyperlinked to the
corresponding web page. A user can therefore return to any web page represented in the
history map by clicking on the appropriate node 240, such as"J". A circle around one of the nodes"N"indicates the last web page visited by the
user. Node"K"is a corporately sponsored node which is emphasised by a border 280
in order to bring it to the user's attention. For example, node K might represent a web
site being promoted by the owner. It will be appreciated that a node icon may be
emphasised in many other ways. Any node may be emphasised in return for a
sponsorship fee, providing an additional form of revenue for the second party. Advertising 290 is provided in a strip 300 at the bottom of the history map 230.The advertising may appear at predetermined times, or may constantly be displayed in
the map 230. It will be understood that advertising, promotions, or messages may be
presented in many different ways on the graphic display means 210, such as in other
windows, formats, or media. For example, advertising could also be displayed when
profile information is provided to a user, or when a user submits either a query,
communications, or information to the second party 30. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that embodiments described may
be implemented by appropriate computer hardware and software. It will also be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the invention is not
limited to applications on the internet, but could be used on any other private or public
access network. It will also be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations
and/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific
embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly
described. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects to be
illustrative and not restrictive.</txt>
