Advertisements On A Website"
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a method of displaying information units,
feedback and advertisements on a website and in particular to a method which
facilitates the posing and answering of questions of public interest, the gathering and
distribution of news and the display of geodemographically targeted advertisements. The invention has been developed primarily for use with an internet web site and
will be described hereinafter with reference to this application. However, it will be
appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular field of use.BACKGROUND
In democratic societies individuals have traditionally banded together in order
to draw their leaders'attention to particular issues or questions of concern to them.Common methods of gathering support from other individuals have been by means of
petitions, rallies, picket lines and the like. It goes without saying that leaders in the
political or corporate areas are more inclined to provide an answer to a question if a
large number of people have expressed interest in it, as opposed to a question posed by
one lone individual. Such prior art methods of obtaining support for a cause, or an answer to a
question, usually require a great deal of human effort. In the example of a petition,
one or more individuals must speak to, and obtain the feedback from, a large number
of other individuals by physically asking each one of them whether they are interested
in the question at hand, or if they support the cause. The act of physically speaking to
a large number of individuals, or interest groups, therefore requires considerable
effort. In the case of a rally or petition, assessing the level of public interest in a
particular issue or question is determined by the size of the rally or petition. Arranging
such a rally often requires a great deal of organisation, such as the posting of posters,
arranging a starting place for the rally, speaking to numerous people and asking them
to show their support by attending the rally. Such prior art methods of assessing and displaying public interest in a
particular question or cause have a number of disadvantages. Firstly, such methods usually require a great deal of effort by many individuals
to gain enough public support to bring the issue/question to the attention of the leader
or corporation concerned. Secondly, such prior art methods do not accurately show the degree of public
interest in a question or issue. The number of people attending a rally, or signing a
petition is not necessarily indicative of the extent of public support for an issue. A
rally or petition may over-represent or under-represent the public interest in the cause
or question concerned. In the case of a rally, two hundred people may attend a rally
but many more may support the cause of the rally but may not have sufficient
inclination or ability to attend. As such, a rally may under-represent the degree of
public interest. Alternatively, in the case of a petition, such petitions usually only
show how many people approve of the question being posed, or the cause being
supported, and there is no indication of how many people refused to sign the petition. For example, a petition with one thousand names on it may appear fairly persuasive to
the recipient of that petition. However, it is feasible that ten thousand people may
have disagreed with, or not cared about, the question being posed, and refused to sign
the petition. As such, a petition may over-represent the degree of public interest in the
cause or question concerned. In addition the role of news gathering has, in the past, usually been performed
by employed journalists working for large media organisations. Such organisations
generate a great deal of revenue from sales of their particular media and advertising
space. Such revenues are not often passed down to the journalists who research and
generate the news. In addition, the media industry is typically very difficult to break
into and there are no means for budding journalists to display their ability to research
and write a news item. Furthermore, using current techniques it is very difficult to display
advertisements which are specifically targeted at a person in a particular
geodemographic group. Often a scattergun approach is used, based on the theory that
the more advertisements there are out in the public arena, the more likely it is that the
right people will see it. Internet advertising techniques also rely on a similar principle.The number of times a banner advertisement is displayed on websites is usually
simply in proportion to the amount of money the advertiser was prepared to pay.Little regard is had for matching the geodemographic profile of the advertisement with
the geodemographic profile of the web content the ad is displayed next to, or the
geodemographic profile of the visitor that is viewing that particular page. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of
displaying information units, feedback and advertisements on a website which will
overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of these deficiencies of the prior
art.THE INVENTION

embodiment of the invention. A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with
reference to Figures 1 to 12.Referring to Figure I. the method of receiving and displaying an information
unit on a website and receiving and displaying information unit feedback on the
website includes a number of steps. The first step involves receiving 4 the
information unit 1 from an information unit entry device 5. The next step involves
displaying 6 the information unit on the website 2. The next step involves receiving 7
information unit feedback 3 from a feedback entry device 8, and displaying 9 at least
part of the feedback 3 on the website 2. The information unit may be a question, an
answer, a news itcm, an issue statement, an issue response or the like. The
information unit entry device 5 is a computer which can access the website 2 via the
internet. Alternatively, the device 5 may take the form of any known device which is
capable of acccssing the internent. The information unit feedback 3 is provided by a visitor to the site 2 via the
feedback entry deviceS The feedback is a comment or rating on the importance or
adequacy of thc in (ormOion unit. For example, if the information unit was a question,
the corresponding feedback 3 would include a rating as to the importance of that
question, a rating as to the adequacy of the way the question was framed and may also
include a comment about the question. In this way, visitors are able to indicate their
support for a parti cular question or issue of public importance, thereby increasing the
likelihood that thequestion or issue will gain the intention of the relevant political or
commercial body. Each of the steps described in Figure 1 are described in greater detail below with
reference to Figures 2 to 12.Referringto Figure 2, the step of receiving 7 the information unit 1 includes the
step of reviewing 10 the information unit 1 and either accepting 11 the information
unit or rejecting 12 the information unit. As shown in Figure 3, the information unit
has a corresponding author 13 and a corresponding reviewer 14. The step of accepting11 the information umt 1 involves the additional steps of allocating 15 an incentive 16
to the author 13 and allocating 17 an incentive 18 to the reviewer. This incentive may
take on a numbcr of forms. In the preferred embodiment the step of allocating 15,17
the incentive I i) * i 8 to the author 13 and reviewer 14 respectively, involves adding a
number of incentive points to the author's or reviewer's incentive account (not
shown). At least some of the incentive points are also put into another account, such
as the incentive account of a particular charity. At some later stage, the incentive
points may be converted into cash, in proportion to the revenue generated by the
website 2. In this cmbodiment, the number of incentive points allocated to an author
13 increascs as the number of visitors viewing the information unit 1 increases.TurningtoFigure 4, the step of rejecting 12 the information unit, involves the
steps of allocation 17 an incentive 18 to the reviewer 14. It also involves forwarding
19 a rejection notice 20 to the author 13. The rejection message 20 includes reasons
as to why the informaiton unit 1 was rejected along with an invitation to resubmit an
amended Lii, it. In this way me quahty of information units appearing on the web site can be
regulated by the review process. In addition, authors and reviewers can gain incentive
points by contrilutin, or reviewing infolmation units. In this embodiment, at least
part of the advcrLising revenue generated from the website is passed on to the authors
and reviewers. This incentive scheme encourages more people to contribute to the
site, thereby increasing the value of advertising space on the site, thereby increasing
the value of the incentive pomts earned by contributors. As shown in Figure 5 the information unit 1 may take the form of a question 21
an answer 22or a news item 23. Alternatively, the information unit 1 may take the
form of an issue statement or an issue response.Referring to Figure 6, when the information unit is a question 21 having acorresponding addressee 24, the step of displaying 6 the information unit 1 on the
website 2 involves the steps of displaying 25 the question 21 on the website 2 and
forwarding 26 the question 21 to the addressee 24. In this way, questions of public
interest may bc posed to particular individuals or organisations. The step of
forwarding 26 the question 21 to the addressee 24 could be performed as soon as the
question is received, Preferably, however, the question is only forwarded to the
addressee 24 once. : certain amount of feedback 3 about the question 21 has been
received, which indicates that the question is sufficiently important to forward it to the
addressee. The step of forwarding 26 the question 21, in that case, also involves
forwarding 26 the feedback 3 to the addressee 24, so that they can see the public
importance of the cucstion 21.Referring back to Figure 1, once a question has been sent to an addressee 24,
and the addressee sends an answer, the information unit shown in Figure 1 takes the
form of an answer 22. m that case, the method involves the steps of receiving 4 the
answer 22,displaying 6 the answer 22 on the website 2, receiving 7 answer feedback 3
and displaying 9 the answer feedback on the website 2. In this way questions of
public importance, addressed to specific individuals or organisations can be given
public support through the feedback mechanism and answers to those questions can
also be given puhhc feedback relating to the adequacy or otherwise of the answer
provided. In this way, the method of the present invention provides a valuable public
forum that overcomesmany of the disadvantages of the prior art. The above described method may not only be used to pose questions of public
importance and receive answers to those questions, it may also be equally applied to a
method of gathering news items. As shown in Figure 7, when the information unit 1
is a news item 23. me step of displaying 6 the information unit 1 on the website 2
involves the steps of displaying 27 the news item 23 on the website 2 and forwarding
28 the news item 23 to a set of potential media contacts 29. These contacts 29 include
television broadcasters 30. printed media publishers 31, radio broadcasters 32 and the
like. A number ofdifferent arrangements are envisaged for the forwarding of news
items to such contacts. For example, a particular news item may be offered to a
contact at a certain price. If the contact wishes to publish that item, they accept the
offer and pay that price. The step of forwarding 28 the news item 23 to the contacts
29 may either he performed as soon as the news item is received, or after feedback 3
has been received m relation to that news item. Such feedback may take the form of
comments or ratmes as to the importance of the news item 23, its truthfulness or
otherwise. and the like. If such feedback is taken into account, contractual
arrangements may be entered into with media contacts such that news items which
receive a predetermined amount of feedback are forwarded to the contact. If the
contact then chooses to publish the item, they are obligated to pay a certain price. In
one embodiment, that price is in proportion to the amount of feedback which the item
received. Alternative arrangements are also envisaged. In this way, traditional
disseminators or news hems can receive additional information from individuals,
effectively creamy a virtual news organisation, without the associated infrastructure
costs. Individualswishing to contribute such news items are allocated incentive
points, along with any additional incentives or credits which the contacts 29 may wish
to pass on. The method of receiving and displaying information units on a website as
described above is not only useful for posing and answering questions of public
importance and gathering news items, it is also particularly well adapted for
displaying geodemographicaHy targeted advertisements on the website 2. This
method is aimed at serving up advertisements which are particularly appealing to
persons who are likely to be reading a particular information unit. Although this
aspect of the invenuon will be described in the context of the method of receiving and
displaying information units on a website, as described above, the method may also be
applied to any w ebsite w hich contains information units and which displays
advertisements. Before the method of displaying geodemographically targeted advertisements
can be perform@@@ an informaiton unit database 33 and an advertisement database 46
must be set up. Hure shows a method of generating an information unit database
33. That method involves the steps of receiving 34 a set 35 of information units 36,
37 and 38. The hext step involves generating 39 a set 40 of information unit profiles
41, 42 and 43. These profiles are geodemographic profiles which estimate the
geodemographic profile of visitors who are likely to wish to view the information
units. The profiles take into account a number of factors including the visitor's
nationality, their age, their occupation, their education and the like. The next step
involves assciaung 44 each of the units 36, 37,38 with one of the profiles 41,42, 43.In this way, a particular informaiton unit 36 will have a particular profile 41 associated
with it, that profitc reflecting the likely geodemographic profile of a visitor who might
wish to view the informaiton unit 36. The next step involves storing 45 the
information units ind their associated profiles in the information unit database 33. Figure 9 shows a similar method for generating an advertisement database 46.That method includes the steps of freceiving 47 a set 48 of advertisements 49,
These advertisementswin normaHy take the form of banner advertisements.However, any type of internet compatible advertisement may be used. The next step
involves generating 52 a set 53 of advertisement profiles 54,55,56. Once again, these
are geodemographie profiles which estimate the profiles of visitors who are likely to
want view the ad\ ertisement, or visitors who the advertisers would like to view the
advertisement. hi one embodiment, the advertisment profiles include a range of
demographic proieswhich the advertisments are aimed at, ratherthan just a singledemographic prottfe. The next step involves associating 57 each of the
advertisements. 42. 50.5 i with one of the profiles 54,55,56. The next step involves
storing 58 the advertisements and their associated profiles in the advertisement
database 46. Once the m formation unit database 33 and the advertisement database 46 have
been generated. the method of displaying geodemographically targeted advertisements
on the website can be performed. That method is illustrated in Figure 10. In the
context of the above described method of displaying information units, the step of
displaying 6 a pariicular infonnation unit 38 on the website 2 involves a number of
steps. The firs'steps invoive searching 59 the information unit database 33 and
identifying 60 that mformation unit's associated profile 43. The next step involves
searching ()tile advertisement database 4G and identifying 62 a selected
advertisement O which has an associated profile 56 which most closely matches the
information unit's profitc 43. The next step involves retrieving 63 that advertisement
51 from the ad. ertisement database 46 and displaying 64 it on the website 2. In the
preferred embedimem. the advertisement 51 and information unit 33 are displayed
next to each other on the same page of the website 2. They may also be linked to one
another or c) osc ! y reiated in a similar way. In this way the present invention provides a method for displayingadvertisements @@@ing a particular geodemograhic profile near information units
having a similar prelile, on a website. In this way, visitors who have a particulargeodemographie profne which inclines them to want to view a particular information
unit will be served with an advertisement near that information unit which is also
likely to appeat to them. In this way, advertisers can more readily target theiradvertisement. @@ visitors can be served advertisements which are more appealing to
them. An advalvcli form of this profile matching method is illustrated with reference
to Figures 11 and 12. In the above description, the geodemographic profiles of a
particular information unit or advertisement may have been originally developed by
someone estimating the profile of the type of visitor likely to be interested in theparticular information unit or advertisement. The following method provides a way ofadjustingtheestimatedprofileof a particular advertisement or information unit to
more closely match a known profile of a visitor viewing that advertisement or
information unil. As shown in Figure 1 1 this method includes a number of steps. The first step
involves receiving 65 member identification information 66 from a member via the
feedback entry device 8 The next step involves receiving 67 a member profile 68
from the deviceiicxt step involves associating 69 the member identification
information 6 6 with the profile 68 and storing 70 them in a member database 71. The member identification information 66 includes a user name and password.The profile 68 includes geodemographic informaiton such as that described above
with reference to the informaiton unit and advertisement. Because the profile 68 has
been provided !)me member him/herself, it is a more accurate profile then the
estimated profiies of the informaiton unit and advertisement. Using this more accurate
profile, the advertisement and information unit profiles can be amended to more
accurately refleet the geodemographic profile of the visitors who actually view them. As show @ @ Figure 12, this involves a number of steps. The first step involves
displaying 72 a selected advertisement 73 having an associated profile 74 on the
website 2. The next step involves detecting 75 a particular member viewing the
advertisement. particular member having particular member identification
information 76. This detccting step may be performed by any known means. In the
preferred embodiment, the member, when first visiting the website 2 enters his/her
user name and password so that their member identification information 76 is known.The step of detecting 75 the member viewing the advertisement 73 is then performed
when the member clicks on the advertisement. The next step involves scarching 77 the member database 71 and identifying 78
the particular member's associated profile 79. The next step involves searching 80 the
advertisement database 46 and identifying 81 the advertisement's associated profile
74. The next step invoives comparing 82 the particular member's profile 79 with theadvertisement's profile 74. The next step involves amending 83 the advertisement's
profile 74 to more Joscty resemble the member's profile 79. The final step involves
storing 84 the amended profile 74 in the advertisement database 46. In this way, by knowing the profile 79 of a particular member, and by detecting
75 that that member views a particular advertisement 73, it is possible to amend the
advertisement's profile 74 to more closely reflect the member's profile 79. As more
and more the advertisement, its profile can be increasingly honed to
accurately refleet the geodemographic profile of those members. This is also useful
for targeting advertisements at non-member visitors, whose profiles are unknown,
since an advertisement can be displayed near an information unit whose profile is
known. Althet@n the above description relates to how an advertisements profile may
be amended to mc doseiv reflect a members profile, the same method can be
applied to impreve the accuracy of an information unit's profile, by amending it to
more closely rcneer the proxies of members who view it. Alternatively, if a member's
profile is unknown, incomplete, or inaccurate, the same method can be used to amend
the member's profile to more accurately reftect the profiles of the advertisements and
information units which the member views. The abovemethod therefore provides a way of displaying geodemographically
targeted advertiseemnts on a website. A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with
reference to Figures 13a to 16. This sccond embodiment focuses on a particular
implementation of the method of posing questions, receiving answers to those
questions and receiving fecdback on those questions and answers. This secand embodiment is preferably implemented by means of a computer
system that ope. @@es in the following way :
Step 1: As shown in figure 13 (a), the first step involves the drafting of a
question by an either. The author may be any person, including but not limited to a
ntural person, representative or employee of any corporation or organisation or
government. question drafted by the author will be written with a particular
addressee in mm@ The addressee may be any person, including but not limited to a
natural person. a representative or employee of any corporation, organisation, or
government boay,
Step 2: as snown in Figure 13(a), the question sent by the author and is
entered into the'.stem. ! n the preferred embodiment, the system includes an Internet
website winch. cessible by the author from the author's computer. However, the
preferred embe@ment would also include alternative means for the author to enter to
question into tr. e system, such as by e-mail, by facsimile, by ordinary post etc. These
latter methods. 1 forwardmg the question to the system would be achieved by
appropriate data entry means which could include automatic text retrieval andinterpretation methods, such as optical character recognition, parsing scripts and/or
human interve. nion. As shown in Figure 15, the system of the preferred embodiment includes a
question atabase recerd. The question database record of the preferred embodiment
includes !ietu.!'rauthorinformation,question information, visitor feedbackinformation, viaitor statistie information and reviewer feedback information. In tupis first step the author enters author information into the question database
record, ineluding the author name, author address, author e-mail address and selects
or de-seleets as @@@thor name publication flag to indicate whether the author wisheshis/hername te @@published with the question. or whether the author wishes to remainanonymous. Step 3: In the preferred embodiment the author also enters the question, the
suggested addressee and nominates an appropriate category into which the question
falls. Prefera the list of categories at; east include subject categories and
geographic eate, @@@ but may ahernatively be divided in a number of different ways.Preferably, the subject categories cover categories at least relating to international
issues, federalllernmem issues, state government issues, environmental issues and
issues relating to utilities such as power, water and telecommunications. In the
preferred emiz@@@nem, the list of categories is expandable, allowing additionalcategories to b@@@@@@ as the need arises. Step 4: Once the author has written the question and it has been entered into
the system tog@@@ with his/her author information, and once the author has selected a
category for the question. the author informaiton is stored in an indexed, secure
database, available only to a site manager, and the question is electronicallytransferrecl to ! bc in'st available category reviewer, for the particular category. The
question then appears on the work list of the category reviewer which is displayed by
the category r@ e. s computer, when the category reviewer logs on to the system.In addition. when the question in transferred to the work list of the category reviewer a
brief e-mail mesasge is esent to the e-mail address of the category reviewer, indicating
that the category reviewer has received a question. Step 5;t'penreceipt of the question, the category reviewer may do one or
more oftheiui...
a) edit an @@@@ copy of the question;
b) attach qsJon comments or question suggestions to the question;
c) appove or reject the question, whereupon;
d) the systam selects the appropriate category master ; and
e) transmm @e original question and an editing copy of the question and anyattaches @@ uestion comments or question suggestions to the system worklist of
the category master. Examples of typical messages shown in the worklist of
categor reviewers and the system worklist of category masters of the preferred @@bodiment are shown in Figure 16.Step @@ pen receipt, the category master may do one or more of the
following:
(a) further eait the editing copy of the question;
(b) attach @@ ther question comments or question suggestions to the question;
(c) approve the question as an edited question or an unedited question; or
(d) reject the question. Step 7N If the category master approves the question as an edited question
the system:
(a) sends a eifieation message to the author by e-mail, or by the same means in
which the @aestion was originally received ; and
(b) releascs the edited question for viewing on the Internet website together with
the auther's name (if the author activated the author name publication flag);
(c) sends the edited question to the addressee together with a unique answerpasswo@@ The edited question may be sent by any conventional meansinciudi:.Lnotlimitedtooneormore of email,facsimile and ordinary post.(d) if the aumor is a member, the system also :(i)..:..!designatedincennveibr an approved edited question to the
member's incentinve account; and
(ii) the designated incentive for an approved edited question to the @@@ber's charity incentive account. Step 7i: !'the category master approves the question as an unedited question,
the system wouid perform the same steps as 7A, except that an unedited question
would be sent to the addressee and the incentive added to the member's incentive
account and @@@@ meentive account would be an unedited question incentive, rather
than an edited westion incentive. In the preferred embodiment, the value of an
unedited question incentive would nonnally be greater than that of an edited question
incentive, sinc... _, mthor should be rewarded for drafting his/her question in anappropriatctorm@@ without need for input from the category reviewers or the category
master. Step 7C: I the category master rejected the question, the system:
(a) sends arejection notification message to the author by e-mail, or by the same
means, aich the question was original received. Preferably, the rejectionnouftc..'messageincludesaninvitation for an author to amend and resubmK the question ;
(b) marks the cdited question and unedited question as an unavailable question,being inaccessible on the Internet wcbsite by either members or visitors ; and
(c) if the a. @@ a member, the system adds a rejected question incentive to the membe'..ce.uivcaccount. Also shewn in figures 13(a) and 13 (b) is the section of the system of the
present invention which allows for the receiving, processing, accepting and posting of
an answer on the Internet website. Whilst this process may be implemented in a wide
variety of \'..--.efer'e.!embodimenL is preferably implemented in accordance
with the folio\,, : @@@ eanled deseription :
Step 1 : As shown in Figure 13 (a), the first step involves the drafting of an
answer by na addressee. The addressee may be any person, including but not limited
to a naturai per...arepresentativeoremployee of any corporation or organisation or governmentStcj)@@@@ shown in gfigure 13(a), the answer is sent by the addressee and is
entered into the system together with the supplied answer password. In the preferredembodiment.'':.systemmeiudes an Internet website which is accessible by the
addressee from the addressee's computer. However, the preferred embodiment would
also include ahernative means for the addressee to enter the answer into the system,
such as by cmail, by facsimile, by ordinary post etc. These latter methods of entering
the answer inti me system would be achieved by appropriate data entry means which
could incmde.'n'ma'ictextretrievalandinterpretation methods, such as optical
character recognition, parsing scripts and/or human intervention. Step 3 : Once the answer and supplied answer password have been entered
into the system. the answer password supplied is compared with the correct answerpassword for th.'arttcuiar question.Step 4@@@ the supplied answer password does not match the correct answer
password, then'a.i.-;werissonbacktotheaddressee with a new correct answer
password and password rejection message. The password rejection message
indicates to the addressee that if the addressee docs not supply the new correct answer
password wnh ms/hcr answer, then the system will not process the answer for
publication on: Jnternet website. Step 4b the supplied answer password matches the correct answer
password, the aaswer is transmitted by the system to the category reviewer(preferably-me'.egj.'yreviewerreviewingtheanswer is the same category reviewer
who reviewed @@@ initial question) in the form of an answer database record. In the
preferred embe ment. the answer database record includes such information as theanswer, addre@@@ ormation and question cross-referencing information such as a
question number. Preferabty, the answer database record further includes fields for
reviewer fecdback informaiton, visitor feedback information and visitor statisticinformation. Step Jtice : Once the category reviewer has received the answer in its answer
database record, he or she may enter answer comments and/or answer suggestions in
the reviewer feedback informaiton field of the answer database record. Step @ : Once the category reviewer has reviewed the answer, he or she
activates the an@@er processing flag in the answer database to indicate that the answer
has been processed. The system, then sends the processed answer database record tothe appropriate category master.Ste receipt of the answer in its answer database record, the
category master thep reviews the answer, together with any answer comments or
answer sugjes:'-'-ovidedbythecategoryreviewer. The category master will then
either accept or reject the answer provided by the addressee. In the preferredembodiment, the answer provided will almost always be accepted, since the addressee
should be allow toanswerthe question the way he/she/it chooses. However,
reviewing the ver ensures not only that the correct addressee has provided theanswer byt @@@@ @@@ @@@ answer does not contain inappropriate (offensive, libellous
etc.) materiez@@@@@ addition, the category reviewer or category master may wish tosuggest that further questions be posed to clarify issues not addressed by the answer. Step S.V. If the answer is rejected, the system will send the answer back to theaddressee tog@h with an answer rejection message. This answer rejection message
will preferably @@@@ omunaents on the reasons for rejection by the category master. Ste 8B : If the answer is accepted, the system:
(a) marks t ! : j answer as an available answer and releases the answer for viewing
on the huernet website :
(b) sends an answer acceptance message to both the addressee and the relevant category reviewer.Turning now to Figures t4 (a) and 14 (b), there is shown a flow diagram,illustrating the @netionality of the system which facilitates the access of, and input
from, visitors to the Internet website, in accordance with the following steps:
Stcp i: in the preferred embodiment, a visitor access the Internet website
using the visitor's computer and views the opening page. Preferably the opening page
at least includes site raie informaiton, headlines for the top ten questions and incentiveinformation. The visiter may view question and informaiton on the Internet website byenterin*, through the members entry or the visitors entry. To enter through the
members entry, me visitor must be a member and opportunity is given to become a
member by the visitor filling out a membership entry form.When the visitor becomes a member,he/she is given a member password
which he/she eners on the opening page each time he/she visits the Internet website. If the visaor enters the system through the members entry, then incentive
points are added to that members incentibve account when the member:
(a) makes commems aboat a question; and/or
(b) enters a@@ing for a question. If the visaor enters via the visitor entry, then any incentive points earned are
added to the incentive account. Step 2: Once the visitor has entered the system, either through the visitor's
entry or the member's entry, the system displays the categories in which questions
have been made availablc, Preferably, the system also includes means for the visitor
to enter a question number, if the visitor already knows the question number of the
question which they are interested in. Step 3A: If the visitor enters the question number, then the system displays
the question tog@@rer with a vistior question feedback entry screen. In the preferredembodimenm the visit@r question feedback entry screen allows the visitor to provide
visitor feedback information in the form of either a visitor comment and/or a visitor
rating. Such visitor comments will preferably be suggestions for improvement to the
question or correetions/additions to the question.thethe p@@@ tee embe liment, the visitor rating would preferably be a rating on
the imprtance the question, This may ake the form of a simple two-button system
in which the visitor may indicate "Yes : they do want an answer to the question"or
"No: they don't eare about the question",
tn the preterred embodiment, if an avswer has already been provided to a
question by the demon addressee, then that answer would be displayed in closeproximity to @@ @ question feedback entry screen on or next to a visitor answer
feedbacl@ entry sereen. Preferably, the visitor answer feedback entry screen would
include means f@@ a visitor to enter visitor answer comments and/or visitor answer
ratings. Suci : ishr answer comments would preferably provide a visitor'sassemssment @@@@ ansver p. ovided by the addressee. Similarly, the visitor answer
rating would pro\ ! dc a rating of the answer provided by the addressee. This means forentering the visitor answer rating could also be a simple two-button system such as
"Yes: I am satisi a with the answer" or "No: I am not satisfied with the answer". Step 3B: a the visitor did not select a particluar question number, but selected
a particular category, the system would display the appropriate question and answer
display serecn for the particular category selected by the visitor. In the preferred
embodimem, the question and answer display screen would preferably include a
plurality or @@@ @@@. togeemr with any associated answers that have been provided
by the addressees. In addition, the question and answer display screen of the preferred
embodiment will also include advertisements which are appropriate to the category. Step 4. When the visitor selects a particular question the system displays the

incentive pomts we available, the inventors envisage at least the following means of
redeeming incendve points:
(a) The first means for redeeming incentive points will be in the form of shares
and/or an enut to shwes in the first public share offer of the system. In thisredemption, me ownr of thc incentive points would receive a percentage of shares in
proportion to the amount of incentive points they have accumulated in relation to the
total incentive?-i.:'awardedbetweenthedate of inception of the system and the date
of the first pabli @ffer. In the preferred embodiment, the individual would receive
90% of any such shares and their nominated charity would receive 10% of any such
shares
(b) In addinon.incentive points which have been earned by visitors who are not
members w@@@ arrably be accumulated in a non-member incentive account and the
shares owe@@@ @@n-member ineentive account would preferably be applied to
such charities as voted upon by members and visitors during a specified voting period.(c) Further means of redeeming incentive points, in the preferred embodiment,
would be in the form of payments based on a proportion of the advertising revenue
generated. (i ol'ici-ed oii the Internet website in closeproximity to @@@ of oher information units in categories which are most closely

means which controls the display and/or billing of advertiseemnts in the advertising
space located in close proximity to questions of relevance to the goods/services being
advertised. In the preterred embodiment, the cost of the advertising space to the advertiser
will be in proportion to the number of visiors which visit and view the question which
is in close proximity to the advertising speacc being hired. Preferably. the advertising management means also includes means for relating

similar methods, mechanisms and codes which perform similar tasks in relation to
statements, rather than questions. In such an embodiment, the present invention
would serve as an electronic forum in which authors could raise issues in the form of
issue statements. Such issues could have a particular person in mind who can or
should address that issue (an issue addressor). Alternatively, the author may not have
a particular issue addressor in mind but is seeking support for the issue from the
visitors to the internet web site, which they provide in the form of visitor feedback
information. Alternative embodiments are also envisaged. Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples,
it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in
many other forms.</txt>
